ltly is a cloud-native URL shortener designed for simplicity and ease-of-use. It provides two endpointsâ€”one to shorten URLs and another to redirect shortened URLs. Leveraging DynamoDB to store the URLs, ltly is accessible via a website, an API, and a Chrome extension. Shortened URLs are served from a personal domain with a `/s` suffix.
